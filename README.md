# 🤖 Generative AI-Powered Support Ticket Resolution

This project focuses on developing a **Generative AI application** to automate the classification and processing of support tickets in a business environment. Leveraging the **Mistral 7B-Instruct Large Language Model (LLM)** from Hugging Face, the application utilizes zero-shot inference and few-shot inference prompting techniques to:
- 🎟️ Predict ticket categories
- ⚡ Assign priorities
- ⏳ Estimate resolution times
- 💬 Generate responses based on sentiment analysis

The emphasis is on using AI to efficiently handle customer feedback, allowing Product Managers and Analysts to focus on high-impact issues. Ultimately, this structured, AI-driven approach enhances the customer experience, optimizes resource allocation, and supports data-driven decision-making.

## 💼 Business Context
Organizations increasingly recognize the pivotal role **customer feedback** plays in shaping products and services. The ability to **swiftly and effectively respond** to customer input fosters enhanced customer experiences and serves as a catalyst for growth, prolonged engagement, and nurturing lifetime value relationships.

For dedicated Product Managers and Product Analysts, staying attuned to the voice of customers is not just a best practice; it's a strategic imperative. 

While organizations may be inundated with a wealth of customer-generated feedback and support tickets, managing these inputs requires more than just processing. A structured approach is necessary to discern the most pressing issues, set priorities, and allocate resources judiciously.

One of the most effective strategies available is harnessing the power of **automated Support Ticket Categorization**, achieved through the modern use of **Large Language Models and Generative AI**.

## 🎯 Project Objective
The goal is to develop a **Generative AI application** using a Large Language Model to automate the classification and processing of support tickets. The application will:
- 🗂️ Predict ticket categories
- 🚦 Assign priority
- 🕰️ Suggest estimated resolution times
- 📝 Generate responses based on sentiment analysis
- 📊 Store the results in a structured DataFrame
